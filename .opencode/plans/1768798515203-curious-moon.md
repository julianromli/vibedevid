# Status Check: International Page `/en`

## Summary

**RESULT: `/en` page IS WORKING** ✅

The English landing page at `/en` is functioning correctly with full i18n support.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Added metadata translations** to `messages/en.json` and `messages/id.json`
2. **Updated `app/layout.tsx`** to use `generateMetadata` with `getTranslations` for dynamic page titles
3. **Updated `i18n/request.ts`** to read locale from `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie
4. **Added dynamic `lang` attribute** on `<html>` tag based on current locale

## Verification Results

| Route | Page Title | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| `/en` | "VibeDev ID - Vibe Coding Community #1 in Indonesia \| AI-Powered Coding" | ✅ English |
| `/` | "VibeDev ID - Komunitas Vibe Coding No. 1 di Indonesia \| Coding Pake AI" | ✅ Indonesian |

## Files Modified

- `messages/en.json` - Added `metadata` namespace with English translations
- `messages/id.json` - Added `metadata` namespace with Indonesian translations  
- `app/layout.tsx` - Converted to async, added `generateMetadata`, dynamic `lang` attribute
- `i18n/request.ts` - Added cookie-based locale detection fallback

## Technical Notes

- Uses `next-intl` with `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` strategy
- `/en` shows English content, `/` shows Indonesian (default)
- Locale stored in `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie for persistence
- OG meta tags and Twitter cards now also localized
