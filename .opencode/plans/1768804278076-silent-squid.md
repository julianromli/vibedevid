# Plan: Improve Root AGENTS.md

## Context

The user wants to analyze the codebase and improve the root AGENTS.md file to be ~150 lines, containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands (especially single test)
2. Code style guidelines (imports, formatting, types, naming, error handling)

## Current State

- **Existing AGENTS.md**: 193 lines at `D:\Projects\Vibe Code\vibedevid_website\traecommunityid\AGENTS.md`
- **Sub-directory AGENTS.md files**: 6 files (components, hooks, lib, app, tests, scripts) - detailed docs
- **No Cursor/Copilot rules**: `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` do NOT exist
- **Key configs**: Biome (linter/formatter), Playwright (tests), TypeScript strict mode

## Analysis

The current AGENTS.md is already well-structured but at 193 lines (target: 150). Key areas to condense:

| Section | Current Lines | Issue |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Commands | 30 | Good, comprehensive |
| Universal Conventions | 45 | Good |
| Security & Secrets | 8 | Minimal |
| JIT Index | 35 | Can remove Quick Find Commands - not useful |
| Unified Patterns | 37 | Comments system example is detailed |
| Definition of Done | 11 | Good |

### Recommendations

1. **Remove "Quick Find Commands"** - These bash commands (bunx find, findstr) are Windows-specific workarounds and not useful for agents
2. **Condense Comments System example** - Keep usage but trim code example
3. **Keep all test commands** - Essential for agents
4. **Add missing context**: 
   - `bun tsc --noEmit` is CRITICAL because `ignoreBuildErrors: true` in next.config
   - Debug mode for tests: `bunx playwright test --debug`

## Implementation Plan

### File to Modify
- `D:\Projects\Vibe Code\vibedevid_website\traecommunityid\AGENTS.md`

### Changes

1. **Remove "Quick Find Commands" section** (lines 111-132) - saves ~22 lines
2. **Condense Comments System section** - reduce code example, keep key info
3. **Add test debug command**: `bunx playwright test --debug`
4. **Add unit test command**: `bunx playwright test tests/unit/` for unit tests
5. **Keep all essential content** for agents

### Target Structure (~150 lines)

```
# VibeDev ID - AI Agent Guidelines (Root)

## Project Snapshot (~8 lines)

## Commands (~35 lines)
- Install, dev, build, type check, lint, format
- ALL test commands including debug and unit tests

## Universal Conventions (~50 lines)
- Code Style
- Imports  
- Types
- Naming
- Error Handling
- Commit Format
- Branch Strategy

## Security & Secrets (~8 lines)

## JIT Index - Directory Map (~15 lines)
- Package Structure (links to sub-AGENTS.md)
- Project Documentation links

## Unified Patterns (~20 lines)
- Comments System (condensed)

## Definition of Done (~12 lines)
```

## Verification

After editing:
1. Confirm file is ~150 lines: `wc -l AGENTS.md` or count in editor
2. Ensure all essential commands are present
3. Ensure code style guidelines are complete
4. Verify markdown renders correctly

## Execution Complete ✓

- **Final line count**: 160 lines (down from 193)
- **Removed**: Quick Find Commands section (~22 lines)
- **Added**: `bunx playwright test --debug` and `bunx playwright test tests/unit/`
- **Condensed**: Comments System example and Directory Map section
