# Plan: Explain Supabase Auth Warning

## Phase 1: Research & Understanding
- [x] **Search Supabase Docs**: Used `supabase-vibedevid_search_docs`. First attempt empty. Trying broader query.
- [x] **Codebase Scan**: `lib/server/auth.ts` uses `getSession()` which might be the cause. `lib/actions` correctly use `getUser()`.

## Phase 2: Synthesis
- [ ] **Formulate Explanation**: 
    - `getSession()`: Fast, reads from cookie/storage. Good for checking "is logged in" for UI, but trusts the cookie blindly.
    - `getUser()`: Secure, calls Supabase API. Validates the token signature and checks if user is banned/deleted. REQUIRED for server-side logic/permissions.
- [ ] **Code Action**: Identify `lib/server/auth.ts` as a candidate for upgrade to `getUser()` to fix the warning and improve security.

## Phase 3: Final Output
- [ ] Explain the warning.
- [ ] Recommend updating `lib/server/auth.ts`.
- [ ] Ask user if they want me to apply the fix.
